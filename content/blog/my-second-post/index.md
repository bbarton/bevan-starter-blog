Our reasoning is flawed in predictable ways. Luckily, we can learn to spot these thinking errors, AKA cognitive biases, in ourselves and others.

Why study cognitive biases? Because they affect nearly every aspect of life. To understand these biases is to understand the bizarrely shaped lens that distorts human perception and understanding. Understanding cognitive biases helps you:

- Assess reality more objectively
- Perform better and inspire better performance in others
- Craft messages that are more likely to spread and be acted upon

The forthcoming posts will summarize each bias and list some ideas of how to apply this knowledge. Each summary is a by-product of my attempt to understand these biases. They were written primarily to help me absorb these ideas, but I hope they're useful to you too.

I'll be releasing these once per day. Enjoy!
