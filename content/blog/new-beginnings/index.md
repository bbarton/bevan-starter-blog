**Champions of an innovation tend to recommend its widespread adoption without regard to its limitations (1).**

Familiarity with a particular technology blinds us to its relative value. This bias can have us make inflated predictions about a technology's adoption.

Technologies whose proponents may exhibit pro-innovation bias:

- Diets and exercise routines (proponents claim a specific regimen to be a panacea)
- Spiritual practices ("this meditation technique is the answer to your problems and the world's")
- Blockchain and AI / machine learning
- Sociological theories
- Atomic energy and personal computers (the ideas that atomic energy would touch almost every facet of life (2), and that computers would replace paper (3))

Some technologies, such as electricity and the internet, have indeed become universally adopted. But they’re far less common than we assume (see Availability Bias).

How to use:

- **Investing:** discount your excitement about a particular technology, and take the public's pro-innovation bias into account.
- **Self-development:** When you’ve discovered that new thing (journaling, meditation, nutrition) recognize it’s just one of many avenues to self-development.
