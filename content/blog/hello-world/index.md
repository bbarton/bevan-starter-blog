**We become more likely to do things as others do them.**

Why are we more likely to “jump on the bandwagon,” often ignoring our own information, when we see others doing something?

- For guidance: we draw inferences from others’ actions.
- To be on the winning team: we like to be in the in-crowd.

This bias is evidenced in fashion trends, and when people change their opinions to the majority view during elections.

The tendency to mime our peers is an energy-saving heuristic that can also save lives: imagine seeing your tribe running in a certain direction: better join them! This effect suggests that in the evolutionary environment, being aligned with the group was often more important for survival and reproduction than being right.

How to use:

- **To grow a movement:** visibly endorse it (1).
- **Marketers:**
  - If people are using your product or service, show it with user reviews, testimonials, public actions.
  - Create incentives for your audience to publicly endorse you.
  - The Bandwagon effect can hurt your product too: a public exodus can cause others to abandon you (2).
- **Public policy:** Don’t warn people against an activity by indicating that many others are doing it (ie littering); that’ll encourage others to join in.
- Don’t follow others off of a cliff: when a movement, action, or market is gaining momentum, detach and look at the facts before jumping in.
